                    Medical Alumni News Letter, October-November , 1957. The caption for the photo
                    reads: "Dr. J. Hamilton Allan explains how the Hubbard tank will be used in
                    the treatment of handicapped children at the Children's Rehabilitation
                    Center to some members of the University of Virginia Hospital Auxiliary.
                    "(Left to Right) John F. Harlan, Jr., Assistant Director of the University
                    of Virginia Hospital, Mrs. Leon S. Dure, Jr., Mrs. William B. Dolph, Dr. Allan,
                    Mrs. Frank T. Sutton, III, and Mrs. John B. Rogan." The article reads (in
                    part): "The University of Virginia Hospital Children's Rehabiliation
                    Center began operation on November 18. "Located on Route 250, approximately
                    two miles west of the University on the site of the old Rucker Home, this
                    comprehensive diagnostic and treatment center will provide rehabilitation and
                    convalescent services for thirty children handicapped by medical, neuromuscular,
                    and orthopedic conditions. "In addition to comfortable and attractive
                    four-bed wards which open directly on to terraces, the Center has a clinical
                    area consisting of complete treatment facilities, a physiotherapy unit, an
                    occupational therapy section, dining and recreation room, consultation and
                    administrative offices, a schoolroom, and living accomodations for a resident
                    physician and the nursing supervisor. The building is completely airconditioned.
                    "Planning for the Center began approximately two years ago when President
                    Colgate W. Darden, Jr. appointd [sic] a Planning Committee composed of Vincent
                    Shea, Comptroller of the University, Chairman; Thomas K. Fitz-Patrick, Dean of
                    the School of Archictecture; John M. Stacey, Hospital Director; and Dr. J.
                    Hamilton Allan, Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics. "Financed
                    jointly by Hill-Burton and prviate funds, the Center cost $421,700.
                    "Architects for the Center were Stainbuck &amp; Scribner of
                    Charlottesville, in association with Mr. FitzPatrick.... "The rehabiliation
                    program at the Center is designed to be a community project, Dr. Allan
                    emphasized, supported by the co-operation of every social, health, and welfare
                    group which has anything to do with the welfare of children.... "'An
                    objective of the program will be to shift the focus of attention from the
                    handicap itself to the problem of meeting the needs of the child as a
                    whole" [Dr. Allan said].... For information on the Hubbard Tank see The
