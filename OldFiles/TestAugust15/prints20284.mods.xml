   <abstract>July 1953, Other individuals not identified, From the cover of the Medical
                    Alumni News Letter, July 1953. The relevant article, on pp. 6-7, is entitled
                    "Dr. Edwin P. Lehman Will Retire As Surgical Chief in Fall," and reads
                    (in part): Dr. Edwin Partridge Lehman, former president of the American Cancer
                    Society who has served for 25 years as Professor and Chairman of the Department
                    of Surgery and Gynecology of the School of Medicine and as Chief of the Surgical
                    Service of the University Hospital, has announced his retirement of the first of
                    September.... "Teaching...is closest to the heart of the 'chief,'
                    as Dr. Lehman is affectionately called. He...is most proud that of all the young
                    doctors who have trained under him in the five-year postgraduate course, not one
                    selected for the responsible position as senior resident has ever failed any
                    part of the American Board of Surgery examinations.... One medical student
                    impressed with the surgical chief's masterly instruction remarked that when
                    Dr. Lehman greeted him with, 'It's a fine day,' he not only
                    believed that the day was a fine one, but felt impelled to study just why and
                    how the day was fine. Dr. Lehman is known most widely, perhaps, for his interest
                    in the field of cancer control and the cancer work for which he was awarded the
                    J. Shelton Horsley Memorial in 1948.... Dr. Lehman is a graduate of Williams
                    College in 1910 and Harvard University Medical School in 1914....He came to the
                    University of Virginia as professor and chairman of the department of surgery
                    and gynecology in 1928."</abstract>
